I'm a PhD student studying [Learning Health Systems](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/learning-health-sciences) at University of Michigan under the supervision of [Dr. Karandeep Singh](https://kdpsingh.lab.medicine.umich.edu/). My research focuses on applying statistical and machine learning methods to electronic health records (EHR) for risk predictions and making causal inference. Prior to becoming a PhD student, I worked as a statistician at Michigan Medicine, analyzing treatment effectiveness for cirrhosis patients in US population and providing statistical consultations to multiple clinical research teams. Currently, I'm particularly interested in how to leverage the power of EHR data and machine learning to generate new knowledge in health at a low-cost setting.

I hold a master’s degree in Applied Statistics from the University of Michigan and a bachelor’s degree in statistics and economics from Boston University. In my free time, I enjoy being in the nature, hiking, backpacking and scuba diving, but I also enjoy staying at home, where I can cook, make coffee, and watch movies.
