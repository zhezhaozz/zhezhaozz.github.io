I'm a PhD student studying [Learning Health Systems](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/learning-health-sciences) at University of Michigan under the supervision of [VG Vinod Vydiswaran, PhD](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/lhs/vg-vinod-vydiswaran-phd). My research interests focus on how we can efficiently extract clinically meaningful information from medical big data. The specific approach I'm pursuing is the (seeded) topic modeling, a type of semi-/unsupervised ML algorithm to conduct clustering with minimum annotation effort. Prior to becoming a PhD student, I worked as a statistician at Michigan Medicine, analyzing treatment effectiveness for cirrhosis patients in US population and providing statistical consultations to multiple clinical research teams.

I hold a master’s degree in Applied Statistics from the University of Michigan and a bachelor’s degree in statistics and economics from Boston University. In my free time, I enjoy being in the nature, day hiking and backpacking, but I also enjoy staying at home, where I can cook, make coffee, and playing video games.
